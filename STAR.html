            <p>
                The main purpose of this class was to simulate operating as a game development company
                and the professor would be our "client" who approached us with a GDD he created. This GDD
                was based on a boardgame concept he designed and wanted us to turn it into a variant of his concept. 
                Each student had to decide what department they wanted to be in and if they wanted to be head of 
                that department. The overall timeline was to create a revised GDD, alpha, beta and deliverable builds 
                within 1 semester or roughly 4 months. In order to stay consistent with deadlines and meetings we used 
                <span><a id="scrum-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum">SCRUM</a></span> 
                during the entire production. Collectively, the entire class agreed to maintain the original 
                concept as best as we could and decided to create a virtual turn-based 2D sci-fi strategy game.

            <h5 class="title-color">Game Concept</h5>
            <p>
                While reviewing the original GDD it has a very similar feel to Stellaris and
                Sid Meier's Civilizaiton games, so we decided to create the game with similar atmoshpere. There are 4 races
                within the game each having their own unique cultural background and allows up to 4 people to
                play. Each player starts out with 1 home system and ship with the goal of expanding their empire
                across the galaxy. Once players reach a certain point in the game they will either have to choose,
                become a trader or raider. The path that the player chooses will determine what unique set of rules
                the player must follow to then win the game.

                        <li>Allowed to trade with other traders with the benefit
                            of not having any restirctions on trade. Traders can
                            custom trade anything and are not restricted to fixed pricing.

            <div id="STAR-role">
                <h5 class="title-color">Role: Lead Artist</h5>
            <p>
                I decided on the Lead Artist role because I wanted to understand the coordination of artists being able to
                produce assets together and how that corrolates with the other departments as a whole. Within 
                the 'Art Department' there were 8 artists including myself and I had the challenge of
                delegating tasks to each student who all have varying schedules. In addition to being Lead Artist 
                I assisted in conflicts within the class and organized meetings associated with the Art Department 
                along with separate meetings including the producer and leads.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once tasks were established I had all artists create their own workloads including myself. This 
                was the optimal choice to help balance workloads and have artists select tasks that interested them. To also 
                help assist keeping the department on track with deadlines, work completion and preventing burnout I created 
                some guidelines:
            </p>

            <div id="department-rules">
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Art Department meetings will be held once a week outside of class to stay 
                        up to date on what is completed, in progress and any issues that need to be 
                        resolved.
                    </li>
                    <li>Select the tasks that you are confident in completing in a timely manner.</li>
                    <li>
                        If all your tasks are completed ahead of time and with approval I will assign 
                        you to assist any fellow artist that are requesting assistance.

            </div>
            <p>
               The chosen style of the game was pixel art since assets can be created fairly easily without
               any prior experience. Aseprite is a pixel art design program that can be bought through Steam
               and that was the program I used for my assets. Some of the artists didn't want to purchase 
               Aseprite so I found an alternative, which I have used in the past call Piskel. Piskel is a 
               free pixel art program that is web-based and only requires creating an account. The project was 
               built using the game engine Unity because all of our programmers were most familiar with it. Below 
               are the assets I created for this project:

                <p>
                    The Fungi race has a fleet that looks like a collection of different ships from the other races, 
                    this is because their biology as a race is intertwined with technology. Because of their biology 
                    and adaptability it allows them to take control over technology that is foreign to them and create 
                    it as their own.

                    Similar to bees the Hive race has a queen who is bigger than the rest 
                    and has a hunger for conquest. The ships for the Hive represent the 
                    combination of technology and their architectural structure that looks 
                    similar to insects from Earth.
