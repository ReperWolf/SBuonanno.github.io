                <h5 class="title-color">Overview</h5>
                <p>
                    Within the class students had to create teams of 3
                    and each group member must have a role of programmer, designer or artist;
                    There was also an additional role of producer so 1 person would be responsible for 2 roles.
                    The project duration was 1 full semester or roughly 4 months with the expectation
                    of building a game as close to completion as possible with a trailer video. For this
                    project my team and I created a demo along with a trailer video.
                </p>

                <h5 class="title-color">Game Concept</h5>
                <p>
                    The goal concept is a puzzle-based playable novel taking place in Salem during the Salem witch trials. 
                    Our main character is Ani(based on the latin word "anima" meaning soul) who is 16 and finds herself 
                    in a situation of the mayor accusing her of witchcraft. This unfortunately leads to her death and the player
                    begins their journey as Ani who has no recollection of her past and must uncover the truth. The player
                    will face different types of challenges and discover the dark secrets that the mayor tries so 
                    desperately to hide while pursuing a parallel journey of finding out who Ani is. Overall, the theme
                    is supposed to give an eerie atmosphere, provide a self discovery journey and face the harsh reality
                    that lies within the game.

                <h5 class="title-color">Role: Programmer and Producer</h5>
                <p>
                    Within the producer role I was in charge of keeping our group coordindated
                    outside the classroom and made sure we were on track with our project's scope.
                    I would touch base with my team members if they were having issues and assisted them in troubleshooting
                    whatever problem they were having difficulty with. My goal as the producer was to ensure our scope
                    was resonable for the timeline, have communication within the group and evenly divide the work if 
                    applicable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the programmer I implemented and integrated all art assets and level designs
                    that my team members created. I also informed them on what would be
                    achieveable within the time frame that we were given from a programmer's perspective. 
                    To add extra challenge within our game I proposed that we create a forest with a hidden 
                    path and if the player looked carefully enough there were slightly different colored trees 
                    to guide them to the next area[time stamp - 2:09 of trailer video]. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Godot as a game engine is known to have a quick learning curve as the programming language is 
                    based off of Python. Its UI is easy to naviagte and utilize the tools available within the program.
                    At the time I was most familiar with Godot and it allowed us to implement what we needed for the 
                    game.
